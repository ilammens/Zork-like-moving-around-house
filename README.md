# Zork-like-moving-around-house
Coding exercice that allows you to move around a five room house.

##What's this?
It's a coding exercice for my university, where we are required to write the code that 
allows you to "move" around a house with five rooms, that are: dining room (starting point),
kitchen, pantry, bedroom and bathroom.
Uses the basics of the game "Zork", and is thus, text based, no nice graphics, sorry :(
